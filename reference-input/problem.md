## Problem: quotes

When brokers and advisors request an initial quote for cover on behalf of their clients (our end-customers) typically experience a lengthy and undertain wait (e.g. several weeks) for a response.

As insurance brokers and financial advisors are seeking the best options (cover, cost etc) for their clients, they typically submit requests to multiple insurers (usually via email) - and thus provide unstructured, and often incomplete, information. 

This results in support staff and underwriters having to spend hours or days manually extracting, structuring, and identifying missing information before the process can proceed - and often requires multiple back and forth requests for additional information.

This extends quote turnaround from hours to weeks, creating a poor customer experience, operational inefficiency and opportunity loss.

Solving this problem could unlock significant revenue opportunity, cost savings, and competitive advantage while improving experience for all stakeholders.
