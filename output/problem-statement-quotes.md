# Problem Statement

## Summary

Insurance brokers and advisors experience lengthy wait times (several weeks) when requesting initial quotes for their clients because they submit unstructured, incomplete information via email to multiple insurers. This forces support staff and underwriters to manually extract and structure information, requiring multiple back-and-forth exchanges. The desired state is immediate identification of missing information, quick responses with guidance to minimize back-and-forth, and structured information requiring no manual processing. This problem creates poor customer experience, operational inefficiency, and opportunity loss, while solving it could unlock significant revenue opportunity, cost savings, and competitive advantage.

## Who

- **Primary audience(s):**
  - Insurance brokers (act on behalf of businesses seeking commercial insurance)
  - Financial advisors (act on behalf of individuals seeking personal insurance)
  - Support staff (process quotation requests and extract/structure information)
  - Underwriters (make risk-based decisions on cover)

- **Secondary audience(s):**
  - End-customers/clients (individuals and businesses that take out insurance cover)

## What

- **Current state:**
  - Brokers and advisors experience lengthy and uncertain waits (e.g., several weeks) for quote responses
  - Support staff and underwriters spend hours or days manually extracting, structuring, and identifying missing information from unstructured submissions
  - Multiple back-and-forth requests for additional information are often required

- **Why this occurs:**
  - Brokers and advisors submit requests to multiple insurers (usually via email) to find the best options for their clients
  - They provide unstructured and often incomplete information

- **Desired state:**
  - Immediately identify any further information needed
  - Quick response with guidance to minimize back-and-forth
  - Structured information requiring no manual processing

## When

- **Situation/triggers:**
  - When brokers and advisors request an initial quote for cover on behalf of their clients

## Where

- **Channel(s):**
  - Email (brokers and advisors typically submit requests via email to multiple insurers)

- **Context:**
  - Quote request process for insurance cover (brokers/advisors seeking best options for their clients)

## Why

- **Customer impact:**
  - Poor customer experience due to lengthy wait times (quote turnaround extended from hours to weeks)
  - End-customers experience delays in receiving insurance quotes through their brokers/advisors

- **Business impact:**
  - Operational inefficiency (support staff and underwriters spending hours/days on manual processing)
  - Opportunity loss from extended turnaround times
  - Potential for significant revenue opportunity, cost savings, and competitive advantage if solved
  - Improved experience for all stakeholders if solved

## Original statement

## Problem: quotes

When brokers and advisors request an initial quote for cover on behalf of their clients (our end-customers) typically experience a lengthy and undertain wait (e.g. several weeks) for a response.

As insurance brokers and financial advisors are seeking the best options (cover, cost etc) for their clients, they typically submit requests to multiple insurers (usually via email) - and thus provide unstructured, and often incomplete, information. 

This results in support staff and underwriters having to spend hours or days manually extracting, structuring, and identifying missing information before the process can proceed - and often requires multiple back and forth requests for additional information.

This extends quote turnaround from hours to weeks, creating a poor customer experience, operational inefficiency and opportunity loss.

Solving this problem could unlock significant revenue opportunity, cost savings, and competitive advantage while improving experience for all stakeholders.
