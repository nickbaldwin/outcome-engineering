The goal isn’t to have AI write presentations for me. It’s to have a thinking partner that:

- Challenges weak problem statements before I waste time on solutions
- Spots missing success criteria I forgot to define
- Asks “why?” when my reasoning gets hand-wavy
- Points out when I’m jumping to solutions before understanding the problem
- Helps me create background docs and explainers that set context for others
