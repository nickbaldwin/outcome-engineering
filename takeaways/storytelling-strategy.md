## A simple framework to turn strategy into a story with four moves

You can turn almost any sound strategy into a compelling story by walking through four steps:

1. Today

2. Tension

3. Tomorrow

4. Translation

This creates a visual journey of our user, with our product changes as their supporting actor in the story that gets them to their destination.

You can think of it as moving from “what it feels like now” to “how this strategy changes the world for real people.”

### Strategy Story Arc

**1. Today**
Start with one or two real personas: a customer, a partner, an internal user. Describe their current journey in plain language. What do they try to do? Where do they get stuck? What does it cost them (time, money, trust, sanity)? Where do they hire your product?

**2. Tension**
Name why “today” is not acceptable. What is the business risk or opportunity hidden in that messy experience? Lost revenue, churn, low adoption, escalating support costs, and reputational risk. How do they feel? This is where the strategy stops being abstract and starts feeling necessary.

**3. Tomorrow**
Paint a concrete picture of their experience when your strategy has landed. Show what is different in their day, their decisions, their outcomes. This is not a “vision statement”; it is a future journey: fewer steps, better defaults, smarter recommendations, less cognitive load. Happiness?

**4. Translation**
Only now do you map your bets and foundations onto that future.

- “This is the bet that makes step three disappear.”
- “This is the system that makes this promise reliable instead of heroic.”
- “This is the technical investment that makes the whole journey fast and safe.” 
- “This is what shows up on their phone screen.”

Through this exercise, you’re anchoring your strategy in lived reality so people can see why the sequence and the foundations matter and how it impacts real people. Frequently in my work, my team would talk about “Farouq the baker,” not the words I put on the page of the strategy deck.

You can do this without hiring a storyboard artist.

Write the journey in plain language first. Then, if you want help shaping it:

> “Here is the current journey for a customer and the future journey we are designing, in bullet points. Turn this into a narrative I can read out loud in three to five minutes, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Flag where I should show product screenshots, and where I should talk about technical foundations as enablers.”
