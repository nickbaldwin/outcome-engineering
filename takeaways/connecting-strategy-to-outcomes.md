How to connect product strategy to business outcomes

Here are [some tips](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/from-feature-factory-to-finance-fluency) on converting product speak to financial speak.

Ask three questions:

1. First, what are the two or three numbers the company cares about this year: net revenue, gross margin, repeat bookings? Dig into segmentation, too.

2. Second, which product levers move those numbers the most: better supply and pricing on certain corridors, more compelling repeat patterns, fewer dead-end flows in core funnels?

3. Third, what is the simplest possible model that connects the product levers to the business outcomes?

This is where AI is genuinely helpful as a calculator that can write in full sentences. You can hand it:

* current traffic by segment,

* conversion rates,

* average order value,

* and a rough idea of repeat behavior,

and ask:

> “Create a simple model that shows how a 1–2 point change in conversion and a 10–15% change in repeat bookings in these three segments would impact annual revenue. Present it back in a way an executive team could understand in a slide or two.”
