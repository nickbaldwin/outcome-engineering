## Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap

You can think about the core chain like this:

* Mission is why the company exists

* Vision is what the world looks like if you succeed. It is usually a bit blurry, like looking through foggy glasses. 
  - Your product vision answers one question: Why does this matter?

* Strategy is how you get there. The set of big, uncomfortable choices about where you play and how you win. 
  - e.g. Market constraints. Value proposition. Cost structure. Tradeoffs. Growth approach.

* Objectives are how you align teams around business outcomes, and tell you what to focus on right now.

* Goals are how you measure if those choices are working. 
  - OKRs work well for this because they separate the objective (inspirational, directional) from key results (specific, measurable). If the objective is “dramatically improve new user activation.” the key results are “increase day-1 retention from 40% to 55%” and “reduce time to first value from 10 minutes to 3 minutes.”

* A roadmap is how you sequence the bets you place to push those goals. 
  - It’s a communication tool that creates organizational alignment around what matters right now and why.



## A good product strategy

* Defines a long-term vision (winning aspiration)

* Is a single, integrated set of choices that reinforce each other and increase your odds of success

* Defines the market (problems) and your playing field’s constraints

* Focuses on customers whom you can’t control

* Has a theory on how to persuade them to do what you want

* Explains what competencies, resources, and systems you need

* Passes the Can’t/Won’t Test. Your competitors can’t or won’t copy it

* Has many levels. In the context of product management, **business strategy is an input for product strategy**.

* Allows you to formulate hypotheses
