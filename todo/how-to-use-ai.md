## Stop using AI to save time. Start using it to 10x your impact.


## The Problem With How Most PMs Use AI

Here’s something I’ve noticed repeatedly: most product managers are using AI wrong.

They’re using it to save time.

That sounds logical, right? If I can create a PRD in 30 minutes instead of 5 hours, I’ve just freed up 4.5 hours. Win!

Except it’s not.

Here’s why: if your 5-hour PRD was a 6 out of 10, your 30-minute AI-generated PRD is probably a 4 out of 10. You’ve saved time but reduced quality. And in product management, quality of thinking directly correlates to quality of outcomes.

**The mindset shift I want you to make:**

| Old Thinking | New Thinking |
|---|---|
| Use AI to save time | Use AI to increase chances of success |
| Create a 6/10 PRD in 30 minutes | Create a 10/10 PRD in 5 hours 
| Be a fast executor | Be a purpose-driven builder |

Your job as a PM isn’t to create PRDs. It isn’t to do user research. It isn’t to write specs.

Those are activities. Your actual job is to solve user problems, achieve business outcomes, and — if we’re being ambitious — make the world a little better through the products you build.

AI is a superpower that amplifies your ability to do that job. It’s not a shortcut to avoid doing the job well.

## A Quick Refresher: What Does a PM Actually Do?

Before we talk about where AI fits, let’s establish what the PM job actually entails. I’ve broken it into three stages:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cel!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dcbbac5-0fcc-479f-b57d-50377bf3ccd6_960x540.png)

### Stage 1: Product Discovery

This is where you figure out *what* to build. You’re trying to identify real user needs and shape problem statements that lead to valuable solutions.

Activities include:

* User research (interviews, surveys, observation)

* Market and competitor analysis

* Stakeholder alignment

* Problem framing and opportunity sizing

* Rapid prototyping and validation

* Data analysis (primary and secondary)

If you mess this up, everything downstream fails. You’ll build the wrong thing efficiently — which is worse than building nothing at all.

### Stage 2: Product Delivery

Now you’ve got a roadmap. Time to actually build. But remember: product management is a team sport. You’re not coding or designing — you’re aligning people and translating insights into shippable products.

Activities include:

* Writing PRDs, specs, and user stories

* Cross-functional alignment (design, engineering, QA)

* Backlog prioritization

* Sprint management

* Quality assurance and testing

* Continuous improvement based on feedback

### Stage 3: Product Distribution (Growth)

This is where many PMs drop the ball. They hand off to marketing and sales and consider their job done.

Big mistake.

Great PMs stay involved in distribution because they understand the user better than anyone. Activities include:

* Creating Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

* Go-to-market strategy

* Messaging and storytelling

* Launch execution

* User activation and retention

* Growth experiments

* Analytics and optimization

The cycle then repeats. Products keep iterating and improving.

**Here’s an exercise for you:** Observe yourself for two weeks. Document everything you do as a PM. Then ask: where can AI help me do this better?

Not faster. Better.

## The 3-Layer AI Leverage Stack

This is the framework I want you to walk away with. It’s how any knowledge professional — especially PMs — should think about integrating AI into their work.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ISLA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b6c1334-82e6-4c5f-a014-81ef554dccbf_960x540.png)

### Layer 1: AI as Thinking Partner

This is the most underutilized layer.

Most people use AI to *do* things. But the real power is using AI to *think* better.

Don’t ask AI what to do. Ask AI to expose your blind spots.

**How to use this layer:**

**1. Break down unstructured problems** You have a messy, unclear problem. Give it to AI and ask it to help you structure it, identify components, and suggest frameworks for analysis.

**2. Explore blind spots** You’ve done research and formed a hypothesis. Now ask AI: “What am I missing? What assumptions am I making? What would someone who disagrees with me say?”

**3. Stress test assumptions** Every product decision rests on assumptions. Give your assumptions to AI and ask it to critique them. “I believe users will pay for this feature because X. Rate my reasoning on a scale of 1-10 and explain why.”

**4. Simulate stakeholders** You’ve talked to 10 users. Upload your notes and transcripts, then ask AI to roleplay as that user segment. “You are now a busy working parent who uses meal delivery apps. I’m going to ask you questions about your experience.”

This isn’t a replacement for real user research. It’s a way to extend and deepen the research you’ve already done.

The key question for Layer 1: **“How can AI help me think better, not just work faster?”**

### Layer 2: AI as Acceleration Engine

This is where most people start (and unfortunately stop). It’s about delegating structured, repeatable tasks to AI.

**Good use cases:**

**1. Competitive data collection** AI can crawl through competitor websites, extract feature lists, pricing information, and positioning statements. What used to take days now takes minutes.

**2. Feature comparison** Need a comparison table of five competitors across 20 features? AI handles this beautifully.

**3. Drafting documents** PRDs, user personas, journey maps, stakeholder updates — AI can create solid first drafts based on the information you provide.

**4. Feedback synthesis** You have reviews from the Play Store, comments from G2, support tickets, sales call transcripts. AI can process all of it and surface patterns you’d never find manually.

**Critical reminder:** Fast doesn’t mean correct.

Just because AI generated something quickly doesn’t mean it’s accurate. Always build verification steps into your workflow. Human oversight isn’t optional — it’s essential.

The key question for Layer 2: **“What structured tasks can I delegate to AI while maintaining quality control?”**

***

### Layer 3: AI as Product Creator

This is the newest and most exciting layer. Tools like Google AI Studio, Antigravity, Lovable, and Cursor now let PMs build actual working prototypes without writing code.

**What this enables:**

* Test more ideas faster

* Validate assumptions with real, functional prototypes

* Show stakeholders working software instead of wireframes

* Run user tests with interactive products

**What this doesn’t mean:**

These prototypes are not production-ready. They’re high-fidelity drafts. For production, you still need to consider security, scalability, privacy compliance, and all the other things that make software actually work at scale.

Think of AI-built prototypes as the ultimate validation tool. Before you commit engineering resources to building something, you can test whether users actually want it.

The key question for Layer 3: **“How can I use AI to build and test, not just think and plan?”**

## The Tools: Google AI Studio and Antigravity

Let me walk you through the two tools I demonstrated in the session.

### Google AI Studio

Google is uniquely positioned in the AI landscape. They have:

* Infrastructure (their own TPUs)

* Data (Gmail, Docs, Maps, Search — they know everything about you)

* Product expertise (they’ve built some of the most successful consumer products ever)

* End-to-end cloud integration

Google AI Studio reflects all of this. It’s a “Swiss army knife” with three main capabilities:

**1. Chat with Models** This is your thinking partner. Use it for brainstorming, document creation, analysis, and critique. Gemini is surprisingly good, and it’s free.

**2. Vibe Coding (GenAI Apps)** Build full applications by describing what you want in natural language. No coding required. You describe the product, AI builds it, you iterate through conversation.

**3. Monitor and Manage** Once you’ve built something, you can deploy it, track usage, and manage resources — all within the same platform.

**Key features I love:**

* **Visual Editor:** Click on any element in the preview, annotate what you want changed, and AI updates it. No more describing UI changes in words.

* **Version History:** Every change is tracked. You can restore any previous version instantly.

* **One-Click Deployment:** Push to Google Cloud Run and get a public URL in minutes.

* **GitHub Integration:** Export your code to GitHub for further development or deployment elsewhere.

### Antigravity

This is Google’s answer to Cursor — a code editor with AI superpowers. But it has some unique advantages:

**1. Parallel Agents** You can spin up multiple AI agents working simultaneously. One builds your app, another creates your GTM strategy, a third researches competitors. They all run in parallel.

**2. Visual Testing** Most AI coding tools only check for code errors. Antigravity actually *looks* at the UI and tests whether things work visually. It’s like having a QA engineer built in.

**3. Massive Context Window** Because it uses Google’s native models, it can handle enormous codebases. This matters when you’re working on real products, not toy demos.

**4. Automatic Documentation** It creates implementation plans, task lists, and even video walkthroughs of what it built.

The main difference: Google AI Studio is cloud-based and great for quick prototypes. Antigravity runs locally and is better for complex, multi-part projects.

## Practical Workflow: Creating a Great PRD

Let me give you a concrete workflow for something PMs do constantly — writing PRDs.

### Step 1: Build Your Swipe File

Start collecting great PRDs. You can find them online, ask colleagues, or look at templates from companies you admire. Store these in a dedicated folder (Google Drive, Notion, wherever).

This becomes your knowledge base. You’re not going to copy them — you’re going to use them as examples that teach AI what “good” looks like.

### Step 2: Gather Your Context

Before you touch any AI tool, collect:

* User research findings

* Market research

* Problem statements

* Business context and constraints

* Success metrics

The quality of your AI output is directly proportional to the quality of your input. Garbage in, garbage out.

### Step 3: Generate with AI

Now upload your examples and context to Google AI Studio (or ChatGPT, or Claude). Use a prompt like:

*“I’m creating a PRD for \[product]. I’ve uploaded examples of great PRDs for reference. Here’s my research and context: \[paste context]. Create a comprehensive PRD that follows the structure and quality of the examples while incorporating my specific information.”*

### Step 4: Critique and Iterate

Here’s where most people stop. Don’t.

Take your generated PRD and ask AI to critique it:

*“You are a senior PM reviewing this PRD. Rate it on a scale of 1-10 for clarity, completeness, and actionability. What’s missing? What’s unclear? What would you push back on?”*

Then iterate. Improve. Repeat.

Pro tip: Use a different AI model for critique than you used for generation. ChatGPT generated it? Have Claude critique it. This reduces blind spots.

### Step 5: Add to Your Swipe File

Once you’ve created a great PRD, it becomes part of your knowledge base. Your swipe file grows over time, and your outputs keep improving.

## A Note on “PRD is Dead”

You’ve probably seen this take on social media. Now that we can build prototypes instantly, who needs documentation?

I disagree.

Prototypes show *what* the product does. PRDs explain *why* we’re building it.

A prototype can demonstrate product flow and interactions. But it can’t communicate:

* Why this problem matters

* How we’ll measure success

* Who the target users are

* What we’re explicitly *not* building

* Dependencies and risks

* Timeline and milestones

Product management is a team sport. You need alignment, not just artifacts. PRDs create alignment.

The real problem isn’t PRDs — it’s bad PRDs. Fifty-page documents nobody reads. The solution isn’t eliminating PRDs; it’s writing lean, focused PRDs that actually get used.

One to two pages. Clear and actionable. That’s the goal.

## Frameworks Worth Knowing

When prompting AI, referencing established frameworks dramatically improves output quality. Here’s a quick reference list:

**For User Research:**

* Mom’s Test (interview questions)

* User Personas

* User Journey Maps

* Empathy Maps

* Jobs to Be Done

**For Market Analysis:**

* PESTLE

* Porter’s Five Forces

* SWOT

* BCG Matrix

* MoSCoW

**For Stakeholder Management:**

* RACI Matrix

**For Behavioral Design:**

* Hook Framework

* BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model

You don’t need to master all of these. Just know they exist and reference them in your prompts when relevant.
