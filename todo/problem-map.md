## PROBLEM

I struggle to find the information I need quickly because it's scattered across too many different systems, slowing down my ability to make important decisions and come up with new ideas.

### OUTCOME

I can instantly access and understand all the information I need, allowing me to make confident decisions faster and drive innovation.

#### OPPORTUNITY #1

Unified Information Hub

##### EXPERIMENT

Centralized Knowledge Dashboard Prototype 

Assumption: Users will find significant value in a single interface that aggregates key information from disparate systems, leading to demonstrably faster information retrieval and reduced cognitive load. 

Test: Build a low-fidelity prototype of a dashboard that pulls in key data points from 2-3 common systems (e.g., Salesforce for CRM, Jira for project management, Confluence for internal wiki). Conduct user interviews with 5-7 target users, asking them to perform specific information-finding tasks on the prototype and observe their efficiency and satisfaction compared to their current methods. Track task completion time and subjective ease of use.

Intelligent Information Synthesis

##### EXPERIMENT

AI-Powered Information Summarization Pilot 

Assumption: Users will benefit from AI-generated, concise summaries of scattered information, enabling quicker comprehension, faster decision-making, and reduced time spent sifting through details. 

Test: Select a specific type of information known to be scattered and time-consuming to process (e.g., customer support ticket threads, project status update emails). Develop a simple AI model or leverage an existing API to generate concise summaries of this information. Present these summaries to a small group of 5-10 users and ask them to rate the clarity, usefulness, and time saved compared to reading the original scattered sources. Include qualitative feedback on the summaries' digestibilty.

Contextual Information Delivery

##### EXPERIMENT

Context-Aware Information Widget 

Assumption: Providing relevant information proactively, based on the user's current task or context, will significantly reduce manual search time and improve the speed and confidence of decision-making. 

Test: Develop a browser extension or desktop widget that monitors user activity (e.g., the website they are on, the document they are editing). Based on predefined rules (e.g., identifying project names, client IDs) or simple keyword matching from the user's current context, the widget surfaces relevant snippets or links from other systems. Test this with 5-7 users for a week, tracking how often they interact with the widget and whether it helps them find information they would have otherwise searched for.
