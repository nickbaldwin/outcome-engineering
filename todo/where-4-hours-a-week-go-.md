# Where 4 Hours a Week Go in Product Management
and The Agentic Workflow that gives those hours back

by Elena Luneva

Dec 30, 2025


Most weeks, product updates start the same way. I would set the when and the what with my team. About 60% of the team would do what was expected, but in their “voice”. Then I would be chasing over Slack, email, and text over the weekend, the laggards. Then came the formatting and reformatting. The bit of misplaced pride that I was adding “my secret sauce”, aka wasting time rehashing what was said into tight “exec” speak. By the time the product update was released, I was already behind on the work I was supposed to do next, and had to start from the beginning of this cycle. It reminded me of a comic in Cat Kid Comic Club that I love to read with my kids. Time Wasters: The Wasters of Time

4hrs per week spent on Product Updates

For a long time, this just felt like the cost of leadership. Communication is part of the job. Alignment takes work. Of course, it takes time. But then AI prompting came about. And now Agents 😇. There is a better way, people!

## TL;DR

* Product leaders lose about half a day a week to product updates.

* Roughly a third of that time is spent translating work for executives.

* Agentic workflows, designed with clear stages and human review, can give hours back without losing trust.

I recently ran a survey with product leaders to put numbers behind what many of us feel intuitively. The results were remarkably consistent.

Nearly 70 percent of PMs spend half a day each week preparing product updates. About 33% of that time is spent translating work for executives. Another 30% percent goes to chasing inputs. That translation number is the one that stuck with me. Almost a third of the time spent on updates is about reframing the same information so it makes sense to someone with a different vantage point. This information system was never designed end-to-end to be ai-native.

Time Spent on Product Updates by Sr. PMs, Directors, VPs and CPOs

If you zoom out, this fits into a broader pattern I’ve been writing and teaching about for a while. In the [AI Executive Stack](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/the-executive-ai-stack), the core thesis is that leaders spend the majority of their time in meetings, often reprocessing the same information in slightly different forms, and what I find is that leveraging AI for this part of the job gives back significant time.

Product updates are one of the main inputs into that cycle and what we spent our time with Subha on. When they’re inconsistent, overly tactical, or manually translated every week, the cost compounds. Meetings multiply. Context resets. Executives ask questions because they weren’t answered in the right frame or were not answered at all.

Teams sense this problem and reach for AI in the most obvious ways. They start with prompts.

* Summarize this Jira board.

* Rewrite this update for execs.

* Make this sound more strategic.

That works for a week or two. Then the outputs drift. The tone shifts. Important details get lost. Someone steps in to rewrite it manually “just this once.” At that point, the conclusion is usually that AI isn’t ready for this kind of work. Instead of starting with the system and re-thinking it from AI-first principles and mapping out where an agent could fit in, AI is dropped into a messy process and expected to clean it up (which it is not good at).

An AI agent is a single entity with a goal and autonomy to choose how it acts. An agentic workflow is a system. The stages are defined, the handoffs are explicit, and human judgment is part of the design, and what Subha spent a significant time on.

### The 5 Core Steps to Automate Product Updates

Here’s the workflow we used to illustrate and teach.

Every week, the process starts with a trigger. A scheduled reminder goes out, so updates don’t rely on memory or heroics. Inputs are gathered from the systems where work already lives: Jira, Slack, Docs, Notion. This is the most time-consuming step and the easiest place to apply automation.

Next comes synthesis. This is where AI helps, too. It summarizes progress, surfaces risk, and flags gaps, leaving you to make sense of the insights. Then the update is tailored. The same facts are framed for different needs. One version is designed to create clarity across the company. Another is designed to support executive decisions. Finally, the update is distributed, and follow-ups are handled once, not five times.

Human review sits after synthesis and before distribution because judgment and accountability matter. If you are putting incomplete or garbage data in, the system will not work.

Weekly Product Update Workflow with Human Review

Under the hood, the system is less complex than it sounds and does not require you to be a coder or technical expert to implement. Signals from multiple sources flow into a single input pack. That pack is processed by an LLM project with fixed rules and structure. Two outputs are generated from the same source of truth: a company-wide update and an executive brief.

Same data. Different framing. No rework.

If you want the agentic implementation workflow for product updates, it’s in the downloads section below.

What’s been most interesting to watch is how predictable the outcomes become once the workflow is clear. Across clients, I work with the same lessons show up. Workflow clarity matters more than model choice. Clear rules outperform fine-tuning. Partial automation beats fragile perfection.

This is a good place to pause and reflect.

Where does your product update process break down most today?\
Is it chasing inputs?\
Translating for executives?\
Surfacing risk early enough?\
Or dealing with the questions that come after distribution?

That answer usually tells you exactly where to start.
