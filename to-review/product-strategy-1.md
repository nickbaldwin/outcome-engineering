As you emerge from the satiation of Thanksgiving, you are rudely dropped into the last three weeks of the year, where planning needs to rush through strategy to the safety blanket feeling that you know what you are doing in 2026. It is with this context that the clients that I work with and the executives that I teach have one word on their mind “STRATEGY”. How do I define it? What in the world is it? How do I communicate it? The list goes on, but the theme is consistent.

I am ready for 2026

Most teams don’t lack strategy. They lack a way to explain it in a way that the CEO, a Staff Engineer, and a CS lead can all repeat without confusion… or eye-rolls, and stick to long enough for the effort to matter.

Upgrade to paid

Over the last few months, I’ve seen the same movie on repeat.

At one company, a CPTO had done all the “right” things. There was a 2026 roadmap, three big “rocks,” Gantt charts, and a carefully negotiated 25% buffer for tech debt. Planning was technically “done.”

And yet, they came to coaching saying some version of:

> “I know what we need to do. I just can’t get everyone else to see it the same way. Foundations sound like a tax. The roadmap feels like a list. The CEO keeps asking, ‘So what’s our strategy?”

Similar theme from a CPO at a travel marketplace. Their company was juggling multiple brands, a central platform team that had been refactoring itself into oblivion, and an app that converted much better than web for reasons no one could clearly explain.

Their OKR spreadsheet looked impressive. Their actual questions were simpler:

> “How do I turn this mess into three clear bets senior leadership can stand behind? And how do I stop the data team from being ‘the dashboard people’ and get them to help drive strategy?”

Different industries, same pattern: lots of motion, not a lot of shared meaning.

This is the first part of a two-part series on AI-native product strategy.

Today, we’ll focus on two things:

* defining the strategy (not just a dressed-up roadmap), and

* turning it into a story that people actually remember and act on.

Next week, we’ll delve into how to turn that story into an operating system: OKRs, roadmaps, rituals, and metrics that keep the strategy alive and start and keep the execution moving against it.

For now, let’s start where most strategy decks pretend to start but rarely do.

### Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap

You can think about the core chain like this:

* Mission is why the company exists

* Vision is what the world looks like if you succeed. It is usually a bit blurry, like looking through foggy glasses.

* Strategy is how you get there. The set of big, uncomfortable choices about where you play and how you win.

* Objectives are how you align teams around business outcomes.

* Goals are how you measure if those choices are working.

* A roadmap is how you sequence the bets you place to push those goals.

[![Strategy in context](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/ $s_!h2PT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762547a0-08b4-48d5-a68f-cbca385fdb7b_1331x457.png "Strategy in context")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h2PT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762547a0-08b4-48d5-a68f-cbca385fdb7b_1331x457.png)

Strategy in Context

You do not need a beautifully worded diagram for your Strategy to be real. But you do need a single page where these choices are written down in repeatable language that your team can relate to, or better yet a visual user journey that shows rather than tells. Going through the process of making the strategy artifact is worth more than the artifact itself, so don’t go crazy; it’s likely to change next year anyway as PMF becomes more fickle.

### Let AI be your brutally honest mirror

This is the part where people normally stare at a blank page, open a dozen other companies’ strategy docs “for inspiration,” and end up rewriting their own mission statement for the fifth time. You can do that, but please don’t.

Before you write anything net-new, you can ask AI a very unflattering question:

> “Given everything we’re already doing, what strategy are we *actually* running?”

I advised the CPTO that I am working with to literally paste in:

* a roadmap summary,

* the current OKRs, and

* a planning deck into ChatGPT,

and asked it to summarize the implicit strategy. The answer was not elegant. It was useful to show the delta of what they thought their strategy was, and how the work they are doing does not reflect it.

If you want to try this yourself, you might start with something as simple as:

> “Here are our current OKRs, roadmap themes, and a planning doc. Summarize the implicit product strategy in 5–7 bullets. Then list three alternative strategies we could pursue with the same assets but are clearly not pursuing, and what tradeoffs they would imply.”

What you get back is not your final strategy. It’s a mirror. It shows you what you’ve already committed to, whether you meant to or not. It helps you reflect on what changes you need to make. From there, you can take a look at the delta of where you want to get to and the strategy you proposed to get there, and determine what needs to be true to actually make it happen.

From there, you can ask the model to translate that same strategy into a language your CEO can consume and relate to.

> “Rewrite this strategy for our CEO \[here is context about my CEO]. Keep it to one paragraph.”

Now you’re not trying to write the perfect strategy in a vacuum. You’re editing, tightening, and correcting something that already exists, spending time in the delta with your AI copilot to define a plan.

### Strategy that touches the P\&L

A lot of the problems I see around strategy come down to one simple issue: the strategy doesn’t obviously touch money. The OKRs are generalized but not measured.

One of the CPOs I worked with had good intentions: increase conversion in local markets, improve mobile experience, grow repeat bookings, and do “something” with personalization. None of that told their CEO, “Here is how this year’s product strategy drives this year’s financial story.”

Here are [some tips](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/from-feature-factory-to-finance-fluency) on converting product speak to financial speak.

We stepped back and asked three questions:

1. First, what are the two or three numbers the company cares about this year: net revenue, gross margin, repeat bookings? We dug into segmentation, too.

2. Second, which product levers move those numbers the most: better supply and pricing on certain corridors, more compelling repeat patterns, fewer dead-end flows in core funnels?

3. Third, what is the simplest possible model that connects the product levers to the business outcomes?

This is where AI is genuinely helpful as a calculator that can write in full sentences. You can hand it:

* current traffic by segment,

* conversion rates,

* average order value,

* and a rough idea of repeat behavior,

and ask:

> “Create a simple model that shows how a 1–2 point change in conversion and a 10–15% change in repeat bookings in these three segments would impact annual revenue. Present it back in a way an executive team could understand in a slide or two.”

Suddenly, a vague “improve mobile CVR” turns into, “If we lift conversion on these lanes by 1.5 points and increase repeat by 10%, that’s roughly X additional revenue this year.” From that sentence, you can work with your team on the how, but the outcomes are much clearer.

It is a lot easier to defend a strategy when you can say,

“We are betting the year on these three levers because together they are worth about this much money,” instead of, “We’re excited about some initiatives that will probably be impactful that you don’t really understand except that they have the word AI in them.”

This is also the exact muscle we build and practice in my course, *[Develop CPO-Level Skills](https://maven.com/elena-luneva/business-impact),* taking product thinking and connecting it directly to the business model, then learning to argue for bigger bets, smarter tradeoffs, and better priorities in language your CFO and CEO respond to. It’s designed for PMs, Directors, and Heads of Product who are ready to operate like a CPO instead of a feature factory manager.

### When the strategy is fine, and the story is the problem

Even when the strategy itself is sound, a lot of leaders get stuck in translation. Picture a fairly standard setup:

A product org has three big bets that make sense, a realistic sequencing plan, and a clear commitment to technical foundations. The roadmap is tidy. The planning doc is thorough. On paper, it all hangs together.

And then they present it.

Executives immediately zoom in on the wrong details. Instead of talking about the big bets, they get into debates about which region is launching first, whether a specific integration should be Q2 or Q3, and side conversations about “overbuilding”.

Engineers, meanwhile, experience the foundational work as an apology slide at the end. “We’ll also try to fit in some technical investments” does not exactly create pride in the work they are doing around infrastructure or confidence that quality matters. If you’re curious about how to position your organization to prioritize quality, [Quality Intervention](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/quality-intervention) has tips for you.

The content isn’t the problem. The delivery is. So let’s walk through how to change the presentation and the narrative. Instead of starting with a list of epics, we start with people.

* People we’re presenting to

* People who are our customers

* People who are doing the work

First, we tell the story of a key persona’s day-to-day: the friction, the double-work, the delays, the “why is this so hard?” moments. Then we tell the story of that same person’s day twelve months from now: fewer steps, clearer choices, less manual work, more value.

Then we do the same for another critical persona on the other side of the product: their current journey, and their future journey when the strategy has landed. Only once those future journeys are vivid do we talk about bets, sequencing, and foundations and the people doing the work.

And the foundations are not a footnote. They show up as characters in the story: the invisible systems that make the new experience possible, reliable, and fast, not an internal tax we grudgingly pay.

### A simple framework to turn strategy into a story with four moves

You can turn almost any sound strategy into a compelling story by walking through four steps:

1. Today

2. Tension

3. Tomorrow

4. Translation

At Nextdoor, we called this Next Next Door. Creating the visual journey of our user, with our product changes as their supporting actor in the story that gets them to their destination.

You can think of it as moving from “what it feels like now” to “how this strategy changes the world for real people.”

[![Strategy Story Arc](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/ $s_!eVh_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e20f4f-b759-4bf3-8567-42201a5c0a81_1728x2304.png "Strategy Story Arc")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eVh_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e20f4f-b759-4bf3-8567-42201a5c0a81_1728x2304.png)

Strategy Story Arc

**1. Today**\
Start with one or two real personas: a customer, a partner, an internal user. Describe their current journey in plain language. What do they try to do? Where do they get stuck? What does it cost them (time, money, trust, sanity)? Where do they hire your product?

**2. Tension**\
Name why “today” is not acceptable. What is the business risk or opportunity hidden in that messy experience? Lost revenue, churn, low adoption, escalating support costs, and reputational risk. How do they feel? This is where the strategy stops being abstract and starts feeling necessary.

**3. Tomorrow**\
Paint a concrete picture of their experience when your strategy has landed. Show what is different in their day, their decisions, their outcomes. This is not a “vision statement”; it is a future journey: fewer steps, better defaults, smarter recommendations, less cognitive load. Happiness?

**4. Translation**\
Only now do you map your bets and foundations onto that future.\
“This is the bet that makes step three disappear.”\
“This is the system that makes this promise reliable instead of heroic.”\
“This is the technical investment that makes the whole journey fast and safe.” “This is what shows up on their phone screen.”

Through this exercise, you’re anchoring your strategy in lived reality so people can see why the sequence and the foundations matter and how it impacts real people. Frequently in my work, my team would talk about “Farouq the baker,” not the words I put on the page of the strategy deck.

You can do this without hiring a storyboard artist.

Write the journey in plain language first. Then, if you want help shaping it:

> “Here is the current journey for a customer and the future journey we are designing, in bullet points. Turn this into a narrative I can read out loud in three to five minutes, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Flag where I should show product screenshots, and where I should talk about technical foundations as enablers.”

You’ll get a rough script back. Edit it until it sounds like you. Then share it with several friendly people at your company and ask them what they think the strategy is. Listen to what they say and if it aligns with what you think you were saying. Then adjust the words and the narrative. Maybe get fancy with Midjourney and Pika Labs, or better yet, work with your designer, visual beats verbal any day.

### Who tells what part of the story

A question that comes up a lot once leaders start getting more intentional about narrative is, “What’s my voice versus my team’s?” You frequently have directors and ICs who have deep ownership of each frame of the journey you are sharing. If you are a great leader, you want your team to shine. However, the tension is that if you are too far in the background, the strategy begins to feel fragmented, and your voice gets lost.

The pattern I coach is simple and tends to generalize:

Company-level forums: board meetings, executive offsites, and all-hands are where you tell the overall story: the context, the strategy, and how the big bets fit together. That is your job as the VP or CPO. You can invite your team to Camio and freshen up the narrative.

Domain-level forums: QBRs, product reviews, deeper dives are where your directors and PMs tell the local story: the specific journey improvements, the experiments, the tradeoffs they’re navigating.

### Please stop showing your Gantt chart to civilians

Gantt charts are fine. For you, your builders, and anyone who finds joy in staring at horizontal bars.

For everyone else, they mostly communicate one thing: “We are doing a lot of stuff. Please don’t ask too many questions. This is too technical for you. Your ask is likely not here. Please just give up.”

One of the CPOs I worked with had a sprawling Gantt chart, a spreadsheet of sprint reports, and an OKR doc full of phrases like “Provide much-needed relief.”

When I asked, “If someone in a non-product role looked at this, could they tell what outcomes we are pursuing this quarter?” the answer was obvious. No.

We rewrote the entire view into a now / near / next story:

* Now was about fixing specific high-leak journeys and reducing self-inflicted complexity.

* Next was about deepening the experience for high-value segments.

* Later was about expansion bets the company needed to start seeding, but not over-weight.

Executive Roadmap

If you are looking for help in thinking about Horizons, my **[Break the Build-Everything-Revenue-Flatline Cycle](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/the-portfolio-strategy-blind-spot)** substack can help.

If you want help translating your current planning artifacts into that kind of view, you can paste the raw material into an AI assistant and ask:

> “Here are our epics, some labels, and a rough sense of sequencing. Group this work into a Now / Near /Next view of outcomes our work will deliver that an executive could understand. For each time horizon, describe the main customer outcomes, the main business outcome, in under 200 words.”

### Where to go from here

If this all feels like a lot, do not try to fix everything in one offsite.

Choose one place to start.

You might write your “strategy on a page” and let AI challenge it from the perspective of the CEO, the Head of Sales, and the crankiest Staff Engineer. You might take one part of your roadmap and rewrite it as a user journey: today versus twelve months from now, with foundations as characters rather than line items. You might force yourself to do a [Think / Feel / Do](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/elevate-your-executive-presence-with) table before your next strategy presentation, even if it’s just on a sticky note.

Next week, in part two, I’ll go deeper into operationalizing your strategy:

* how to translate strategy into sharp OKRs and outcome-based roadmaps,

* how to make technical initiatives and foundations visible and non-negotiable,

* how to set up an operating cadence so you’re not reinventing the story every quarter,

* and how to use AI as a partner in OKR design, sprint reviews, and the uncomfortable question, “Are we actually winning?”

If you’re already feeling the gap between “We have a roadmap” and “We have a strategy I can defend in any room,” that’s the space my courses and coaching live in.
