music-brief.md


Let's build a web app to track music listening and report stats on top artists and songs

Help me think through how to break this into iterative pieces and write a plan.md.

Requirements:

- Google Auth to log in, no user/password - ensure DB schema handles this
- Allow user to connect to their Spotify account, where they'll be listening to music
- Use the Spotify API to get back information about music usage to store in DB
- Add unit tests for business logic, eze tests for core user journies
- Use git and pnpm, use descriptive commits

Design:

- Minimal, functional, practical
- Intentional use of color
- Warmer tones
- Inspired by social apps

Frontend:

- React
- Nextjs
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui
- ESLint 9

Backend:
- Postgres
- Drizzle ORM

Infra:
- GitHub
- Vercel
- Sentry

Check off items in the plan as we accomplish them as a todo list. If you have open questions that require my input, add those in the plan as well.]
