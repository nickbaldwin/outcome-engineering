In [Product Strategy, Part 1](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/product-strategy-part-1), I discussed defining strategy in plain language, using AI as a brutally honest mirror to surface the delta between your strategy and what is planned. From that, we turned strategy into a story that involves the users you are building for, so people can feel and repeat your strategy in the context of happy outcomes for your users. This week is all about what happens after the offsite. How do you turn that strategy into an operating system that runs your year, and lasts beyond the artifact presented in the keynote?

We’ll walk through:

* Connecting strategy to OKRs and an outcome-based roadmap

* Making tech initiatives and foundations first-class citizens

* Setting up an operating cadence that keeps the strategy alive

* Using AI as a partner in OKRs, reviews, reality checks, and status updates

## From strategy to OKRs to outcome-based roadmap

The moment strategy dies in most companies is right after the all-hands.\
Like a Christmas tree, it is dressed up, lit beautifully, and admired by everyone for 45 minutes. Then January hits, execution starts, and the “strategy tree” is dragged to the curb and left there while reality, and every urgent request, lifts their leg on it.

Your product strategy in January

Someone says, “Okay, this is great, but what are our OKRs?”\
Forty-five minutes later, you’re arguing about whether a 2.3% lift in conversion is “ambitious enough,” and no one remembers what the strategy was. In [Your CEO Just Got Back From a Conference. Now What? ](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/how-to-manage-a-ceo-who-drives-product)I discuss how to work with amnesic co-workers, including your CEO, and work through the strategy decay curve.

I recently worked with a Head of Product who was right in this blender. On paper, they had a strategy: focus on high-value routes, grow repeat bookings, and lean into mobile, which converted significantly better than web. In practice, their OKR sheet read like this:

* “Improve mobile experience”

* “Grow non-core markets”

* “Leverage personalization”

Nothing technically wrong, but at the same time, nothing you could steer a company towards. To fix their approach, we focused on tightening the chain from **strategy to business outcome to roadmap,** and added numbers around what good looks like so the team could measure if they’re on the right track.

You can think about it this way:

**Strategy**: Where we play and how we win\
**Business outcomes**: The 2–3 numbers this year lives or dies on\
**OKRs**: Commitments around the strategy & business outcomes\
**Roadmap**: The sequence of bets that give those OKRs a fighting chance

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/ $s_!19-O!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88a8a0e8-2007-485d-b781-59f51a119291_1011x894.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!19-O!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88a8a0e8-2007-485d-b781-59f51a119291_1011x894.png)

Once we stepped back and asked:

* “What numbers really matter this year?” (e.g., net revenue, repeat bookings in specific corridors)

* “Which user journeys move those numbers the most?”

* “What’s the simplest model that connects those journeys to the P\&L?”

…the OKRs shifted from “Improve mobile” to concrete:

* “Increase repeat bookings in customer segment A/B by X%.”

* “Increase conversion in these three local markets by Y points.”

* “Grow revenue from non-core segments to Z% of total.”

Suddenly, the roadmap could stop pretending to be neutral. Every epic either moved those outcomes or it didn’t, and those projects that didn’t no longer had a place on the roadmap. Plus, the reasoning for why they are no longer on the roadmap became clear and defensible.

### OKRs as the Department Unifiers

When OKRs are done well, they become the bridge between GTM and R\&D. Instead of product obsessing over features while sales chase this quarter’s financial fire drill, you give everyone the same business outcomes that matter this year. Product and engineering own the experience, reliability, and new capabilities levers to move those numbers, while marketing, sales, and CS own how those bets reach and convert real customers.

The Key Results make the dependency explicit: “Increase self-serve conversion from X% to Y%” or “Grow revenue from repeat customers by Z%” can’t be hit by one side alone. Suddenly, roadmap discussions, campaign plans, and tech initiatives are all arguments about the how behind driving the outcomes, not competing backlogs, and GTM and R\&D start behaving like one system driving the same outcomes instead of two neighboring departments.

Here is my [workbooks to bring GTM & R\&D ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16AyRZR2x_-jhbymZnxXBIGCeT140P2_B6eYzjueSPlI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.oe21tnekyxs)in alignment around OKRs and Strategy because frequently your situation and the situations I have been in is that the departments are missaligned.

### AI for the first drafts

This is a great place to let AI do the math and the first draft, while you focus on decision-making and alignment.

You can hand your AI assistant:

* Current traffic by segment

* Conversion rates for key journeys

* Average order values

* Rough repeat patterns

…and ask:

“Create a simple model that shows how a 1–2 point change in conversion and a 10–15% change in repeat bookings in these three segments would impact annual revenue. Present it as talking points for an exec slide.”

Now “Focus on mobile” becomes:

“If we lift conversion on *these* mobile flows by 1.5 points and increase repeat in *these* segments by 10%, we add roughly $X this year.”

Much easier to defend in a room than, “We’d like to improve the mobile experience because… vibes.”

Strategy Stack

## Tech initiatives and foundations become first-class citizens

Now let’s talk about everyone’s favorite slide: “Tech debt and foundations.”

One product leader I coached had what many teams dream of: an agreed-upon 25% buffer in every sprint for “run the business and tech foundations.” On paper, engineering had air cover. In reality:

* No one could say what the 25% was spent on

* The roadmap view didn’t show any of it

* Execs heard “we’re slower because we’re investing in tech” and translated it as “we’re over-engineering, too slow, and should offshore the team.”

* Engineers felt like their foundational work lived in the shadows

The issue was that the foundations’ work and quality did not have a voice. In my [Make The Case for Qualit](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/quality-intervention)y, I walk through how to baseline, diagnose, and make the financial case for investment in system stability and product quality.

We fixed two things:

1. **We made the foundations legible.**\
   Teams labeled work as feature vs. foundational, and sprint reports started showing, “X% of delivered points went to reliability/performance/tooling, tied to these metrics.” The outcome is that the work became visible, talked about, and tied to outcomes.

2. **We gave foundations a role in the story.**\
   The foundation’s work was not in the strategy narrative. Once you can say “this quarter we invested \~23% of capacity into foundations and uptime went from X to Y resulting in \[Z] increase in retention resulting in customer LTV increasing from \[A] to \[B],” the conversation shifts from “Why are we doing this?” to “Are we investing enough?”

### Use AI to Turn Concerns into Action

AI is very good at turning vague concerns into concrete instrumentation and a story.

You might ask:

“Here are the last 3 months of incidents/bug reports/performance issues, plus our current ‘foundations’ tickets.

1. Cluster them into themes (reliability, performance, developer experience, data quality, etc.).

2. Suggest 3–5 foundational initiatives we should explicitly name for next quarter, and propose simple success metrics for each.”

Then, when you have the raw data:

“Rewrite these technical initiatives in business language for an executive audience and tie to business outcomes. Where you do not have the data ask me instead of making it up. Keep each to 2–3 sentences and tie them explicitly to revenue, risk, or growth.”

Now your roadmap doesn’t say “refactor X service”; it says “reduce checkout failures in core funnels by 40% and stop lighting the support queue on fire.”

## Build an operating cadence that keeps strategy alive

Even the best strategy and cleanest OKRs will quietly decay if your operating cadence is still built for “features shipped” instead of “outcomes moved.”

One leader I worked with inherited:

* A weekly “Scrum of Scrums”

* A forest of sprint reports (“points committed vs. delivered”)

* A quarterly roadmap review that was essentially a Gantt tour

Everyone was busy. Almost no one could answer, “Is this strategy working?” Or even what was the strategy?

We started introducing a different rhythm:

**1. Product Business Review (monthly or every 6 weeks)**

* Progress against 2–3 strategic outcomes

* What’s working, what’s not, and what we’re changing as a result

* Cross-team issues: dependencies, quality, systemic bottlenecks

**2. Outcome-based roadmap review (quarterly)**

* What we committed to for Now / Near / Next

* What we shipped

* What it did to our key metrics

* What we’re reshaping based on what we’ve learned

**3. Product reviews that match the stakes**\
Some sessions are about shaping the work (discovery / PRFAQ style). Some are about stress-testing decisions with senior leaders. Some are about launch readiness and post-launch learning. Tailor the session audience to the outcomes you are driving and the audience

If you read Strategy [Part 1](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/product-strategy-part-1), this is where your **Now / Near / Next** roadmap and your **Today → Tension → Tomorrow → Translation** stories get baked into the calendar instead of showing up once a year. And if you want a deeper dive on portfolio and horizons, again, *The [Break the Build-Everything-Revenue-Flatline Cycle](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/the-portfolio-strategy-blind-spot)* ties tradeoff and market shift decisions into this way of operating.

### AI as your Chief of Staff

AI is a ruthlessly efficient chief of staff for this layer if you let it be.

Before a Product Business Review, you can drop in key dashboards, recent launch notes, and experiment summaries, and ask:

“Summarize the last month of product work against these three strategic outcomes. Where are we ahead, behind, or off-thesis? Suggest 3–5 questions we should answer in our PBR.”

After a review, you can paste in your notes and ask:

“Turn this messy meeting transcript into a one-page summary: what we decided, what we’re pausing, and what we’re doubling down on. Write it so a non-product exec could follow it.”

When preparing for quarterly roadmap resets, you can feed it your QBR docs and ask:

“Which initiatives appear on these plans that don’t map cleanly to our stated strategy or OKRs? List them and suggest how we might reframe or cut them.”

This is exactly the kind of work the **[AI Executive Stack](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/the-executive-ai-stack)** is designed for: using AI across research, strategy generation, communication, and ongoing influence to create an additional brain for yourself, keep track of all the things, and get out of the 60% copy-and-paste work of your job.

Operating Cadence for Strategy

## AI as a partner for OKRs, ops, and retros

Most teams are now comfortable asking AI to “rewrite this more clearly.” Fewer are using it where it shines in an operating system:

* Spotting inconsistencies between strategy, OKRs, and roadmap

* Generating better questions for reviews instead of more slides

* Acting as a neutral mirror in retros when everyone is a bit defensive

A pattern I like with leaders is a simple three-step loop:

**1. Draft with humans, stress-test with AI.**\
Write your OKRs, roadmap themes, and operating cadence first. Then ask:

“Here are our strategy statements, OKRs, and key roadmap themes.\
a) Summarize the implied strategy in 5–7 bullets.\
b) Point out any OKRs that don’t clearly support that strategy.\
c) Suggest 3 alternative strategies we *could* be running with these assets that we are not.”

You don’t take the output as truth. You use it to see your own blind spots.

**2. Use AI to simulate other stakeholders.**\
This is straight out of your [Executive AI Stack](https://elenasletters.substack.com/p/the-executive-ai-stack) work: ask AI to respond like your CFO, Head of Sales, or Staff Engineer. Make sure you have custom GPTs for these.

“You are our CFO. Given this strategy and these OKRs, what are your top 5 questions or concerns?”

If your “CFO” is mostly asking, “How does any of this touch the P\&L?” you have your answer.

**3. Turn raw data into better rituals.**\
Before retros, you can dump in:

* Launch logs

* Incident summaries

* A few support tickets

…and ask:

“Cluster these into themes for a 45-minute retro. Propose an agenda that focuses us on learning, not blame.”

The goal is to stop wasting human cycles on tasks that a model can accomplish in 30 seconds, so your energy can be directed toward decisions, trade-offs, and leadership.

## **When this system starts to break, what to do about it**

The system dies when no one notices it’s already dead and just begins to go through the motions, without a critical self-reflection around are we getting to the right outcomes. The first sign is usually behavioral: someone asks “what are our OKRs again?” and there’s an awkward pause, or your Product Business Review becomes pure status updates with no actual decisions. Next, you’ll notice the roadmap quietly drifted from your strategic outcomes. Someone shipped a feature that doesn’t touch your key metrics and wonders why they are not getting promoted, and you wonder how it got to shipped. Foundations work evaporates without ceremony (the 25% buffer gets squeezed to 10%, then to “we’ll get to it” or it keeps happening but no one can point to outcomes, again. Incidents spike, and your top engineers start looking at other companies. Finally, the cadence itself breaks: the PBR gets rescheduled, quarterly resets slip, and suddenly you’re back to weekly sprint reports with no connection to outcomes.

If you catch yourself in any of these patterns (or you’ve inherited rituals and you’re not sure why they are happening), stop and do this: spend one hour with your executive team peers answering three questions honestly.

1. “What 2–3 numbers do we care about this year?”

2. “Are our OKRs and roadmap moving those numbers, or did we build something that looks strategic but doesn’t move business outcomes?”

3. “What’s preventing us from running this system. Is it organizational chaos, misalignment at the top, or did we just get lazy about the cadence or had to pivot?”

Usually it’s one of those three. If it’s the third, you fix it in a week: reschedule the PBR, reconnect the roadmap to outcomes, and make foundations visible again. If it’s the first two, you have a bigger conversation about what’s possible this year and if the initial direction still makes sense. But the dangerous move is letting it decay silently and just going through the motions.
