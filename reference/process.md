The general process for all insurance types is essentially the same - except that for life insurance products there is an optional initial step for 'pre-assesment'

Typically a broker or advisor starts the process by contacting multiple insurers to determine the best option(s) for the customer.

## Step 0: pre-assesment

For life insurance products, if an advisor identifies risk factors that might affect an indididual's prospect of obtaining cover, they will outline the areas of concern and ask insurers whether they would consider providing cover. 

At this stage, the information is high-level and may not provide all of the detail required.

## Step 1: quotation

Broker/advisor requests a quote - providing information as required.

## Step 2: application

Customer completes formal application, incuding details and payment info.

## Step 3: onboarding

If cover accpeted, and customer agrees to terms and payment, then creates an acoount.
