# Outcome Engineering

## Purpose

Intended to be a toolkit to help apply good product principles and processes in a structured manner to the things that we need to think through, question, validate, collaborate on, prototype, test and learn from.

Essentially - it should enable a few great things:

1. Break down high level thinking into discrete steps that can be quantified, used across the org, and examined (completeness, reasoning, supported by evidence, assumptions validated etc)
2. For each discrete step - rather than starting with a blank page or inapproraite template - lets you provide some initial thoughts, and then be interviewed, challenged and guided to the point where you have something solid. Then push that as input to the next step. 
3. Enables you to make upstream changes (e.g. new strategy) that can then be reapplied to update the subsequent outputs (e.g. a specific thing to be tested) - removing disconnects and oudated artefacts
